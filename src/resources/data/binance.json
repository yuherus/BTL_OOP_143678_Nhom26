The planet\u2019s most popular artist, as recognized by Guinness World Records, has finally announced that he\u2019ll be bringing his incredible After Hours Til Dawn tour to the region.\nSince kicking off in the summer of 2022, this show has been smashing records and wowing crowds across North America and Europe. With dates already set for South America (Sep-Oct 2023), fans in Oceania were beginning to feel a little left out \u2014 until now!\nWe\u2019re excited to share that this tour, powered by Binance, will be coming to Australia and New Zealand in November and December 2023.

Souvenir NFTs\nDesigned exclusively for fans attending The Weeknd\u2019s shows (residency restrictions may apply), these distinctive NFTs act as a digital keepsake of the performance. This contemporary approach breathes new life into the timeless practice of saving ticket stubs, now reimagined for the Web3 landscape.

Created to recognize The Weeknd\u2019s artistic flair, the Puzzle Box consists of two main parts:\n1. Image Cube Challenge: Players must rearrange image tiles on a cube to solve the visual puzzle in front of them.\n2. Musical Challenge: Participants must mimic intros from The Weeknd\u2019s tracks, testing their auditory skills and memory.\nCompleting these challenges unlocks the cube, bringing you closer to winning exclusive merchandise or even concert tickets (subject to residency). The Puzzle Box offers a test of intellect and a novel way to interact with The Weeknd\u2019s creativity.\n\nMetaverse Dimension: Immersion & Exploration\nBeyond the Puzzle Box lies the fascinating world of the Metaverse Dimension, where fans can delve into the retro-neon aesthetic reminiscent of The Weeknd\u2019s After Hours Til Dawn tour. This virtual space contains four key areas: The Club, Art Gallery, Binance Space, and a Secret Door. \nWithin these domains, players can embark on a treasure hunt, navigating the metaverse in search of hidden diamonds. Success unlocks access to The Stage and VIP Lounge, where bonus material is waiting to be explored. Additionally, as with the Puzzle Box, completing the interactive treasure hunt puts you in a prize draw to win The Weeknd tickets or merchandise.\nA new frontier in entertainment\nEnter The Dimension transcends the traditional concert experience.

No concert ticket? No problem! The virtual doors are open to all, providing an entirely new and thrilling way to engage with The Weeknd \u2013 and possibly win big, too!\nEmpowering Global Transformation\nThe partnership between global superstar Abel Tesfaye, known to his fans as The Weeknd, and Binance goes beyond entertainment. It\u2019s a collaboration that transcends the world of music thanks to its commitment to humanitarian efforts.\nAs a UN World Food Programme (WFP) Goodwill Ambassador, The Weeknd and World Food Program USA established the XO Humanitarian Fund to support WFP\u2019s response to the unprecedented global food crisis.\nBinance, sharing a similar dedication to social responsibility, has taken a significant step in this collaboration by donating $2 million to the XO Humanitarian Fund. But the philanthropy doesn\u2019t end there. Upon the release of the Tour NFTs, 5 percent of the sales will be directed to this vital cause. \n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs The Weeknd\u2019s After Hours Til Dawn global tour moves towards the Australia and New Zealand leg of its exciting journey, we look forward to seeing where this pioneering partnership goes next. Join us as we continue to unlock new opportunities for fan engagement and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible when music meets Web3.

        "post_description": "Main Takeaways\nNFT-Fi is an intersection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\nBinance offers two novel NFT-Fi products: NFT Staking and NFT Loans.\nFrom portfolio diversification to securing loans, discover the unique financial opportunities that NFT-Fi creates and the benefits that Binance\u2019s products offer.\nNFT-Fi is unlocking the untapped potential of NFTs! Discover Binance's innovative NFT-Fi products, NFT Staking and NFT Loan, and how you can benefit from your non-fungible assets.\nThe rapidly growing market of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to captivate the imagination of artists, collectors, and investors globally. With the surge in interest, innovative financial products are emerging to accommodate and leverage the unique characteristics of NFTs. Enter a new concept that has emerged at the intersection of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi): NFT-Fi. \nWhile still in its early stages, NFT-Fi has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry. And at the forefront of innovation is Binance, offering NFT-Fi products such as NFT Staking and NFT Loan.\nExplore the world of NFT-Fi here.\nWhat Is NFT-Fi?\nNFT-Fi bridges non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance, offering essential benefits while reshaping the future of NFT trading and financing.\nDeparting from traditional NFT trading \u2013 which focuses solely on buying, selling, and collecting digital assets \u2013 NFT-Fi incorporates innovative products like staking and lending to maximize the potential of NFTs.\nNFT-Fi also presents groundbreaking financial solutions to tap into the hidden liquidity of NFTs. By enabling fractionalization, tokenization, lending, and using NFTs as collateral, NFT-Fi can unlock the potential of these valuable digital assets. At the same time, NFT users do not necessarily need to sell their assets to enjoy the benefits.\nBenefits of NFT-Fi\nBroader range of financial products\nNFT-Fi introduces an array of financial products previously unavailable to NFT holders. By integrating NFTs with traditional DeFi offerings, users can access various investment, staking, and lending options. This expanded spectrum of financial instruments empowers users to diversify their portfolio and maximize the use of their digital assets.\nEnhanced investment value\nAs the NFT market flourishes, NFT-Fi presents numerous innovative ways to enhance non-fungible tokens\u2019 value as investments. Integrating financial services into the NFT ecosystem unlocks liquidity, allowing users to tap into the potential of their assets without needing to sell them. It also enables fractional ownership and profit-sharing models to attract more investment opportunities. \nAsset-backed financing opportunities\nWith NFT-Fi, users can now leverage their NFT assets as collateral for loans or to secure financing. Binance's NFT Loan product offers users the possibility to unlock the capital tied up in NFTs, providing a new avenue for creating liquidity and fueling further growth in the larger digital asset market. For more information, read our NFT Loans: How to Use Your NFTs to Borrow Crypto guide.\nDiversifying risk and potential returns\nNFT-Fi offers additional portfolio diversification by allowing users to participate in various investment opportunities connected to NFTs' unique attributes. This diversification to a different asset class helps to mitigate risk, distribute potential returns, and optimize portfolio performance.\nIntroducing Binance NFT-Fi Products\nNFT Staking\nUsers can lock their NFTs on a platform or in a smart contract to earn rewards. Through staking, NFT owners can monetize their assets without selling them. Binance currently offers Ape Staking and Sandbox Staking.\nBenefits of NFT Staking on Binance:\nOne click to stake\nStaking rewards are distributed to your account daily\nFlexible-term staking option\nZero gas fees\nJust like staking cryptocurrencies, NFT staking involves taking on specific risks, and rewards may depend on factors such as the rarity, popularity, or utility of the staked NFT. Nevertheless, NFT staking has continued to gain traction as a potentially lucrative opportunity within the rapidly evolving world of NFTs and DeFi.\nNFT Loan\nSimilar to crypto loans, Binance NFT Loan allows owners to use their NFTs as collateral and borrow funds. To obtain an NFT loan, the borrower stakes their NFT on a platform or smart contract, which then lends them a specific amount based on the value of their NFT collateral, usually in the form of a cryptocurrency. Once the loan is repaid, the borrower regains ownership of their NFT.\nBenefits of NFT loans include:\nZero gas fees\nInstant loans\nLiquidation protection\nLow interest rates\nStarting from July 5, Binance is offering a 20% discount on borrowing interest rates. \nNFT Loans are gaining popularity as they provide NFT holders with more flexible financial options. However, borrowers should be aware of potential risks, such as the volatility in NFT prices, which might affect the collateral value during the loan period.\nExplore NFT-Fi\nNFTs have come a long way from being seen as only digital collectibles to becoming versatile assets offering a range of innovative financial solutions. NFT-Fi addresses the limitations of traditional NFT trading, creates new investment opportunities, enhances user experience and portfolio diversification, and ultimately unlocks the liquidity potential of NFT assets.\nA pioneer in the NFT-Fi world, Binance is dedicated to realizing the full financial potential of NFTs. Ready for a seamless experience with NFT Staking and NFT Loan products? Visit the Binance NFT platform and explore our NFT-Fi offerings today.\nRisk Warning: NFTs are subject to high market risk. Obtaining an NFT Loan is completely optional and you do so at your risk, including the risk of liquidation when the value of your NFT collateral drops significantly. You are solely responsible for your participation in this offering and Binance is not liable for any losses you may incur. Always do your own research and seek independent professional advice to determine if this product is suitable for you.

Follow this guide to score yourself an iconic goal from Ronaldo\u2019s career when the sales window finally opens on July 3, 2023. \nNote: This is a general announcement. Certain products and services may not be available in your region. This blog was updated on July 5, 2023.\nThe name Cristiano Ronaldo is synonymous with one thing: goals. \nOver the course of his incredible career, he\u2019s won it all, and proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he really is the greatest goalscorer of all time. With 838 career goals (and counting), no one in football history has hit the back of the net on more occasions than CR7. \nWith his ForeverCR7: The GOAT collection dropping on July 3, you\u2019ll soon have the chance to own one of Ronaldo\u2019s most treasured goals, reimagined as beautiful NFT collectible cards, each coming with unique perks and benefits \u2014 from signed merch to meeting the man himself. \nRead on for all the details you need to shop the football legend\u2019s latest NFT collection.\nNormal NFTs: How The ForeverCR7 Box Works\nAnyone interested in buying a Normal NFT from the ForeverCR7: The GOAT collection will need to snap up one of the ForeverCR7 Boxes we\u2019ll be making available on Binance.com from 14:00 UTC on July 3. \nEach box costs 10 USDT and includes one of seven different designs that make up the Normal (N) NFT collectible cards set. Each design in this tier represents one of CR7\u2019s hundred-goal milestones, from goal 100 to goal 700. \nForeverCR7 Boxes will be on sale until 14:00 UTC on July 23 (or prior to that if all available N NFTs sell out before the cut-off time). N NFTs will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Each user is limited to 50 NFTs.\nRare & Super Rare: How The Subscription Mechanism Works\n1,200 Rare (R) and 120 Super Rare (SR) NFTs from the ForeverCR7: The GOAT collection will be made available via our Subscription Mechanism, priced at 30 USDT for the R NFTs and 200 USDT for the SR NFTs. The purchasing system for these NFTs will run between July 4 and July 13. \nThis mechanism, for those unfamiliar with it, is a way to ensure that all interested users get an equal opportunity to participate in the primary sale of these limited-supply NFTs. Please note this is not a first-come, first-served system; rather, it requires you to take part in a four-step process. \nNot clear on how it will work? Don\u2019t worry: we\u2019ve explained everything you need to know below. Be sure to mark the dates and times on your calendar so you don\u2019t miss out!\nPhase 1: Preparation (00:00 UTC on July 4 to 02:00 on July 10)\nSelect the CR7 NFT(s) you want to purchase and make sure you have at least 0.1 BNB in your Binance account during this phase. This is for you to fulfill the specified BNB prerequisite by meeting the minimum daily average BNB holding requirement. \nChecked the link and still not sure? In most basic terms, you need to be holding an average of at least 0.1 BNB in your Binance account across the entirety of this period. This entry requirement must be met by July 10 (02:00 UTC) in order for you to qualify for the next phase.\nPhase 2: Subscription (02:00 UTC on July 10 to 09:00 UTC on July 13)\nDuring this phase, each user who met the Phase 1 requirement can \u201csubscribe\u201d to participation ticket(s). The function of these tickets is to determine which users will receive the right to buy the R & SR NFTs being sold through the Subscription Mechanism system.\nR-tier NFTs are limited to 12 tickets per user; SR-tier NFTs are also limited to 12 tickets per user. \u201cSubscribing\u201d to a ticket requires you to lock up tokens that correspond to the value of the NFT you\u2019re hoping to purchase. For example, for every R-tier NFT ticket you want, you\u2019ll need to lock up 30 USDT, and for every SR-tier ticket, you\u2019ll need to lock up 200 USDT. \nPlease note that tickets do not guarantee purchase. \nRather, they allow users who subscribe to move to the next stage. Be sure to subscribe by 09:00 UTC on July 13. You can only use the tokens sitting in your Spot Wallet, and these tokens will be locked until the end of Phase 4 (Distribution).\nPhase 3: Calculation (09:00 UTC on July 13 to 12:00 UTC on July 13)\nAll subscribed participation tickets will enter a pool during the three-hour Calculation phase. Users do not have to take any action during this phase. Our system will select winning tickets from this pool between 09:00 and 12:00 (UTC) on July 13. The automated selection process is fair, fully public, and verifiable. For more details on how winners are selected, please refer to Binance NFT Subscription Mechanism Winner Selection Algorithm. \nPhase 4: Distribution (12:00 UTC on July 13)\nOnce the Calculation is completed, you\u2019ll see the allocation details. \nAt 12:00 UTC on July 13, participants with winning tickets will have their locked tokens deducted in exchange for the R or SR NFTs they subscribed to. The NFTs purchased will then be distributed to that user\u2019s Binance account. If you hold a Participation Ticket that does not win, then the corresponding number of locked tokens will be returned to your Spot Wallet. \nPlease note that if you subscribe to multiple tickets, for example, three R and three SR, you may end up with zero NFTs, six NFTs, or any number in between. Winning tickets are picked by the system individually rather than in batches.\nSuper Super Rare: How The Auction Works\nSix of the highly-sought after Super Super Rare (SSR) NFTs \u2014 representing Ronaldo\u2019s greatest goal of all time \u2014  will be sold via auction on Binance NFT. \nThe auction will begin at 14:00 UTC on July 3, with a starting price of 15,000 USDT. Anyone wanting to take part in the auction must be registered on Binance.com. \nThe highest bidders will receive their SSR NFTs once the auction ends at 14:00 UTC on July 5.\nIf there are no active bids on an SSR during that time then the auction for that item will remain live until July 23, 2023 (14:00 UTC).\nNew to Binance?
