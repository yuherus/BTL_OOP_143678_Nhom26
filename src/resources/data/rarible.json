        "post_description": "New market cycles require new solutions.\nWe believe the next NFT bull market is already cooking behind the scenes, powered by mass adoption and innovative brands.\nWhat will this new market look like? Imagine that the ownership and exchange of NFTs is as commonplace as sending an email. The majority of internet users mint NFTs and engage with their digital wallets daily. NFTs are the preferred method for distributing digital goods and services. \nThis future might become a reality sooner than you think.\nMore use cases. More marketplaces.\nDuring the previous bull run, we saw two main use cases\u2014NFT art and PFPs. With the new cycle, we\u2019re about to see a lot more.\nBut the more use cases we get, the less effective the marketplace structure we\u2019re all used to (one platform to trade thousands of projects) becomes.\nDifferent use cases require different user experience, and the ultimate marketplace for a big sports organization will look different from a marketplace for a 10k PFP collection. It\u2019s impossible to host such different projects under one UI.\nThis is where the idea of vertical marketplaces, each catering to its own ecosystem, comes into play.\nToday, we're thrilled to launch what we believe is the ultimate product for the next NFT cycle\u2014RaribleX.\nWhat is RaribleX?\nRaribleX is a turnkey marketplace solution for web3 market leaders and Fortune 500 companies alike.\nLive now, RaribleX is a one stop shop to launch world-class web3 marketplaces. It covers the full product life cycle, from creating NFTs to hosting secondary sales.\nVertical by design, those marketplaces let emerging and established brands own their user experience, unlock new revenue streams and receive protected royalties from each transaction\u2014which, in turn, facilitates the growth of the entire web3 space.\nYes, it\u2019s that mass adoption we\u2019ve all been anticipating.\nVisit x.rarible.com for more details.\nHow RaribleX has been fuelling growth amid the bear market\nWe've been working on RaribleX for the past two years. Now live publicly, it has been used by toy companies, PFP communities, art projects, sports organizations and L2 blockchains.\nFor instance, RaribleX has powered the marketplace for McFarlane Toys, helping the company beloved by collectors across the world take its action figures to Polygon and generate over 1,000,000$ GMV in primary and secondary sales over the past months.\nMattel Creations Virtual Marketplace\nWe're also proud to share that the secondary sales marketplace we've built for Mattel on Flow hosts digital collectibles for two of its flagship IPs \u2014 Barbie and Hot Wheels \u2014 and currently has over 215,000 unique users. With an average transaction cost of $9 and the email log in option, this marketplace is different from the web3 we know. We see it as a glimpse into the future of NFTs.\nFurther, we've been working on a marketplace for Animoca Brands, a web3 titan whose investment portfolio has over 450 companies. The Mocaverse marketplace, home to one of the best performing NFT collections of the current market, has seen over 6,000+ bids placed in wETH and $APE, and a total of 45,000 $RARI distributed in a unique rewards program designed specifically for the marketplace with the RARI Foundation.\nThere's been more marketplaces we're honored to have worked on, and many more to come.\nThe next cycle of NFTs will be different. Let's build it together.\nGet started with RaribleX",

        "post_description": "At Rarible, our main focus right now is building for the next stage of NFTs, a future where the ownership and exchange of onchain assets will be as commonplace as sending an email. This requires us to stay flexible by making certain changes to our products.\nStarting 27 October, 9:00 AM EST, a new regressive fee structure will be adopted instead of the current fixed commission on Rarible.com, along with the option to remove the platform fees altogether.\n\ud83d\udce3\nThe new fee structure is based on the USD price of the NFT that's being traded at the time of the sale, and will work as follows:\n\n$4,000+: 0.5% per each side (the buyer and the seller)\n\n$2,000 - $4,000: 1% per each side\n\n$400 - $2,000: 2.5% per each side\n\n$100 - $400: 5% per each side\n\n$0 - $100: 7.5% per each side\nFor instance, if the current floor price on y00ts is 0.779 ETH ($1,218) and you were to buy a floor priced y00t, you would pay 2.5% of that (~0.019 ETH, or $29) in platform fees. Similarly, you would pay the same amount if you were selling one for that price.\nNotably, this update does not affect any of the Rarible-powered community marketplaces made via the self-service builder, where the fee remains at 0% per each side. Similarly, the custom marketplaces designed specifically for our partners keep the same fees as they had before this update (those fees vary on a case by case basis\u2014please consult each of our partner marketplaces separately).\nHow to pay no trading fees on Rarible.com\nAdditionally, there is an easy way to pay no trade fees at all on your Rarible.com transactions: All you have to do is lock a minimum of 100 $RARI tokens at the RARI Foundation website by following the step-by-step instructions.\nAs long as your tokens are locked, each of your trades on Rarible.com will come with a 0% fee\u2014you'll just have to pay the gas fees and royalties, should the NFT you're buying have any.\nWe\u2019re excited for what the future holds for NFTs, and are constantly looking for ways to keep our product accessible and convenient for all creators and collectors.",

        "post_description": "Even in fast-paced, resilient industries like NFTs, some things are consistent.\nArt Blocks is one of them. Launched in 2020 by Erick \u201cSnowfro\u201d Calderon, the generative art platform hosts over 400 collections that have amassed more than $1.4 billion in volume combined.\nAs someone who had dabbled with creative code in his free time since early 2010\u2019s, Snowfro was so excited about building a platform for generative artists that he had to sell his free claimed zombie Crypto Punks long before the bull cycle (just $200 each\u2014the current floor is 425 ETH) to fund its development.\nNow, with collections like Snowfro\u2019s Chromie Squiggles, Tyler Hobbs\u2019 Fidenza, and Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s Ringers\u2014 you\u2019ve likely seen them on Crypto Twitter, at Sotheby\u2019s, or even as part of permanent collections at LACMA and Centre Pompidou\u2014Art Blocks is the generative NFT art powerhouse that was definitely worth sacrificing a couple of zombie Punks for.\nHow does Art Blocks work?\nThe idea is simple. Essentially, Art Blocks is a publishing platform. Any artist who has written a generative script can go to the website and submit their project for consideration.\nAll projects then go through two screenings: first by an internal screening committee, and second by the Art Blocks Curation Board.\n\u201cProjects are reviewed based on aesthetics, innovation, technical quality, and concept,\u201d Sarah Rossien, Associate Artistic Director at Art Blocks, told Rarible.\n\u201cWe connect artists, blockchain technology, and creative coding into one experience\u201d.\nToday, Art Blocks accepts approximately 15% of submitted projects. About 3% of submitted projects are accepted into the Curated Collection.\nWhat makes Art Blocks stand out in this market?\nOne of the things that stand out about Art Blocks is that despite the turbulence on the market and the underlying bearish trend, the demand for Art Blocks collections has remained consistent\u2014something that most PFP collections have recently been struggling with.\nArt Blocks index is slightly up over the past year.\nLarge-cap PFP index is down more than 50%. pic.twitter.com/pfitOMsYrr\n\u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) July 10, 2023\nRossien largely attributes Art Blocks\u2019 popularity to the relationship between their collectors and artists, and the expectations the former have from their NFTs.\n\u201cUltimately artists releasing on Art Blocks are creating beautiful pieces of art that are seen as such, not only as a potential speculative upside,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cWe always say, \u2018buy what you like at a price you'd like to pay\u2019\u201d.\nAccording to Rossien, Art Blocks\u2019 mission is to host a new generation of artists, one that will expand the definition of contemporary art by taking generative art on-chain.\nWhen asked about the future of the platform, Rossien replied: \u201cWe will certainly expand forever\u201d.\nAfter a recent Rarible Protocol update, you can now easily navigate each of the many Art Blocks collections on Rarible.com\u2014just start typing the name you need into the search bar, and it will pop up as a separate collection. If you don\u2019t know where to start, the list below will help you.\nChromie Squiggle by Snowfro\nChromie Squiggle #5857, 8319\nEditions: 10,000\nDate minted: 27 November, 2020\n\n\u201cSimple and easily identifiable, each squiggle embodies the soul of the Art Blocks platform.\u201d\nCreated by the Art Blocks founder, these lively figures have become synonymous with NFT gen art\u2014so much that holders even shave their squiggles in their heads before going to a conference.\nSome Squiggles are more rare than others, as a lot depends on the colors and lines.\nFidenza by Tyler Hobbs\nFidenza #92, #373, #996\nEditions: 999\nDate minted: 11 June, 2021\n\n\u201cFidenza is by far my most versatile algorithm to date,\u201d as Hobbs describes his most popular collection to date. \u201cAlthough the program stays focused on structured curves and blocks, the varieties of scale, organization, texture, and color usage it can employ create a wide array of generative possibilities.\u201d\nTo understand why Fidenza has been so successful, you have to see The Tulip, collected by punk6529 for 1,000 ETH.\nRingers by Dmitri Cherniak\nRingers #946, 879, 948\nEditions: 1,000\nDate minted: 31 January, 2021\n\n\u201cThere are an almost infinite number of ways to wrap a string around a set of pegs,\u201d says Cherniak. \u201cOn the surface it may seem like a simple concept but prepare to be surprised and delighted at the variety of combinations the algorithm can produce\u201d.\nEach 'Ringers' NFT is derived from a unique transaction hash and generated in Javascript in the browser. One of those random combinations (#879) formed a silhouette of a goose upon minting. It was eventually acquired by now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), then seized by officials. Most recently, it sold for $6.2 million at Sotheby\u2019s.\nMeridian by Matt DesLauriers\nMeridian #987, #981, #790\nEditions: 1,000\nDate minted: 28 September, 2021\n\n\u201cStratified landforms constructed from many small strokes of colour. The hash of each token describes a coordinate within a multidimensional generative space, locating a unique composition that lies along one of many possible longitudes.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, notorious NFT collector Cozomo de\u2019 Medici gifted Meridian #547 to The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).\nFragments of an Infinite Field by Monica Rizzolli\nFragments of an Infinite Field #455, 531, 1013\nEditions: 1,024\nDate minted: 13 September, 2021\nWhen creating this collection, Rizzolli\u2019s goal was to create parameters that resemble a living organism's growth. As a result, she coded \u201ca compositional system in which an idealized plant species is generated and arranged in a potentially infinite field of foliage\u201d.\nMemories of Qilin by Emily Xie\nMemories of Qilin #75, #202, #1000\nEditions: 1,024\nDate minted: 21 March, 2022\n\nInspired by traditional East Asian art and resembling movement of brushwork through its code, the series \u201cexplores elements of folklore, evoking the mythological imagery of dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and mountains\u201d.\nHuman Unreadable by Operator\nHuman Unreadable #386, #109, #388\nEditions: 400\nDate minted: 24 May, 2023\n\nA project on the intersection of choreography, code, blockchain, generative art, and cryptography created by an award-winning experiential artist duo, Ania Catherine and Dejha Ti (Human Unreadable). They are currently shortlisted for the Lumen Prize in generative art.\nThe Harvest by Per Kristian Stoveland\nThe Harvest #287, 370, 286\nEditions: 400\nDate minted: 18 January, 2023\n\nDepicting \u201cworlds that exist in eternal symbiosis with the Caretaker\u201d. According to the artist, each beam has a \u201cposition, color, reach and yield that is calculated and procedurally drawn over time\u201d.\nAnticyclone by William Mapan\nAnticyclone #694, 670, 405\nEditions: 800\nDate minted: 29 April, 2022\n\n\u201cHigh pressure, rotation, air flow\u2026 The \"Anticyclone\" series is an artistic exploration and interpretation of those concepts.\u201d\nFAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT by Maya Man\nFAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT #616, 43, 696\nEditions: 700\nDate minted: 10 August, 2022\n\nQuite different from the rest of the list in terms of aesthetics and visual format, this project boldly aims to \u201cscrutinize the promotion of wellness, self-care, and confidence on social media\u201d. It is also currently shortlisted for the Lumen Prize in generative art.",

        "post_description": "Few shows have cultivated the kind of fan base that Rick and Morty has. As one of the most successful animated shows in recent years, the creation of Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon has become iconic.\nNow, Dan Harmon is launching a new show, this time with the inclusion of NFTs.\nAhead of its premier on September 24 on FOX, let's explore what we know about this series and its use of web3.\nAncient Greece, gods and chaos\nSet in the mythical city of Krapopolis, the show centers around a dysfunctional family of humans, gods, and monsters.\nTogether, they're running one of the world's first cities while managing their own chaotic lives and relationships\u2014and if you\u2019re familiar with Greek mythology or history, you know just how much chaos that might involve.\nHarmon is the show's executive producer, while Jordan Young (Bojack Horseman) serves as the showrunner.\nMeet the characters\nAccording to Harmon, Krapopolis will \"revisit\" Greek myths rather than retell them: for instance, in the show Prometheus will actually get unshackled and freed from eternal torment.  \nThe main characters are therefore made up, but loosely based on Greek mythology:\nTyrannis: The mortal son of a goddess and the benevolent king of Krapopolis; voiced by Richard Ayoade\nDeliria: Tyrannis' mother, the goddess of self-destruction and questionable choices; voiced by Hannah Waddingham.\nShlub: Tyrannis' father, \u201cpart scorpion, part lion, part eagle, part horse, part person\u201d; voiced by Matt Berry.\nStupendous: Tyrannis' half-sister, daughter of Deliria and a cyclops; voiced by Pam Murphy.\nHippocampus: Tyrannis' half-brother, the offspring of Shlub and a mermaid; voiced by Duncan Trussell.\nKrap Chickens, or what makes Krapopolis unique\nThere are some truly unique things about Krapopolis as a show.\nFirst, with zero episodes aired, it has already been renewed for a third season\u2014which is considered to be rare for a new IP in the industry.\nSecondly, it\u2019s one of the first major media properties leveraging web3, as it presents FOX\u2019s first foray into the world of NFTs.\nIn 2022, FOX's blockchain arm released a limited-edition NFT collection called Krap Chickens. These are available on the project's Rarible-powered marketplace.\nHolding a Krap Chicken offers holders exclusive benefits, including early access to episodes, access to the token-gated Shopopolis store, and even the ability to vote on story decisions, deciding what kind of wine Deliria gets to drink and which goat gets \"sacrificed\u201d by Tyrannis.\nWe're currently running a contest where you can win a Krap Chicken:\n**CONTEST ALERT**\n\nAre you a fan of \u2018Rick and Morty\u2019?\n\nIntroducing KRAPOPOLIS, Fox\u2019s newest show premiering Sept 24 created by Dan Harmon.\n\nHere's YOUR chance to be a part of the show & win a @Krapopolis Krap Chicken!\n\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/PWaigvdOfx\n\u2014 Rarible (@rarible) September 15, 2023\nThat wraps up all the key info about Krapopolis we know so far. We\u2019ll make sure to tune in on Sunday\u2014and with 3 seasons confirmed, why not pick up a Krap Chicken (or win one in the contest we mentioned above) and contribute to the show?",

        "post_description": "Web3 is constantly growing, and brands have been bringing their communities to web3 en masse. However, having to pay dozens of dollars to mint or buy an NFT rarely makes sense for newer users.\nAt Rarible, we believe the future of NFTs is in accessible, low-cost NFTs for larger communities of collectors.\nThis is where Layer 2 (L2) solutions come to help. On an L2 network, most transactions are just a few cents and settle in seconds. That\u2019s why even Vitalik said that \u201cwe need to move NFTs onto the layer 2 ecosystem\u201d.\nLet\u2019s unpack our partnership with Mantle in more detail and see.\nMantle Network: An L2 you\u2019ll love\nIncubated by the former BitDAO (now Mantle Governance), Mantle Network is an Ethereum rollup, meaning it batches transactions and sends them to the main Ethereum blockchain. This enables it to operate much faster and cheaper than Ethereum itself.  \nBecause Mantle was incubated by a DAO, it\u2019s also community-led (just like the Rarible Protocol ;)):\nThe community gets to vote on what happens with the $2 billion Mantle Treasury. This has included creating a $200 million ecosystem fund for builders.\nHolders of its $MNT token decide on the product roadmap.\nAnd because every new chain needs an active community, we\u2019ve partnered with Mantle to help them supercharge their NFT ecosystem.\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it:\nRarible x Mantle\nOur partnership consists of multiple components:\nRarible Protocol now supports Mantle Network\nThe NFT marketplace Mintle, which enables trading of any NFT collection on Mantle Network.\nWe believe that building with and for NFTs should be easy. And with initiatives like Game7 already building on Mantle, protocol integration makes it easier than ever to fetch and index the NFTs you need to build what you want.\nThough Mantle Network is new on the block, it already comes with NFTs for you to check.\nNFTs to check out on Mintle\nWhile NFT collections and apps have already started building on the Mantle ecosystem, Mantle is launching two collections itself:\nMantle Journey is an open-access and performance-based program designed to reward users and applications.\nIt offers a soulbound token called Mantle Journey Soulbound Token (MJSBT) for you to mint, and the MJSBT will be users\u2019 Mantle identities to participant in Mantle ecosystem activities and unlock rewards.\nWhen you mint a MJSBT, it indexes activities such as transactions and smart contract interactions, which accrue Mantle Journey Miless and influence the rewards you can claim. This will unfold in epochs or seasons, with points carrying over from one epoch/season to the next.\nRight now, Mantle Journey is running its Season Alpha.\nCitizens of Mantle is the blockchain\u2019s inaugural PFP collection. Each Citizen of Mantle NFT is modular, and dynamically upgradable from a basic character NFT to a character with multiple add-on traits such as headgears, body accessories, etc., as your Mantle Journey progresses.\nThe Citizens of Mantle NFT allows users to unlock these add-on traits by reaching certain thresholds of Mantle Journey Miles. The stunning artwork was created by Chen Man, one of contemporary art\u2019s foremost female artists and fashion photographers.\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude80 Register for Citizens of Mantle Whitelist now\nOutside of the Mantle projects, you can already pick up some cute moles, dogs and wolves! Or are you more into skulls? Anime-type art is always a nice choice too!\nTo get started on Mintle today, you can use your Ethereum wallet address. Simply bridge some tokens to Mantle and pick something up on the marketplace.\nNow let\u2019s go build that L2 future together.\n\u26a1 Explore Mintle",

Head to the marketplace to bid and earn $RARI.\n\n\u2022 Rarible continues its partnership with Mocaverse, a massive Web3 gaming, culture, and entertainment ecosystem.\n\n\u2022 As part of the new rewards program, you can earn $RARI by bidding on the Mocaverse marketplace. Learn more about the conditions below.\n\n\u2022 The program will run from September 18 to November 3, 2023.\nWhat\u2019s better than a cute cartoon PFP that makes you part of a massive Web3 gaming, culture, and entertainment ecosystem? A cute cartoon PFP and some $RARI tokens!\nContinuing our partnership with one of the largest web3 companies \u2014 Animoca Brands \u2014 and its Mocaverse project, we\u2019re excited to announce a new collaborative rewards program.\nIt\u2019s very simple: starting from September 18, you can receive $RARI rewards by making collection bids on the Rarible-powered Mocaverse marketplace, also known as MocaMart.\nThis rewards program was made possible by the RARI Foundation, an independent organization governed by veRARI (locked $RARI) holders, and its initiative to fund incentives for marketplaces built on Rarible Protocol.\nNow let's get to the details.\nHow to earn $RARI on MocaMart\nEssentially, it\u2019s as simple as that: To receive rewards, you must make a collection bid on the Mocaverse marketplace.\nThe Mocaverse $RARI Rewards Program will run from September 18, 2023 14:00 UTC to November 3, 2023 00:00 UTC with a total of 45,000 $RARI allocated.\nHere are some simple rules for this rewards program:\nThe minimum bid requirement is at least 0.75x the floor price. (For example, if the current floor is 1 ETH, you must bid at least 0.75 ETH to be eligible for rewards.)\nOnly bids valid for 5 or more minutes will be counted.\nA snapshot will be taken every 10 minutes starting from September 18, 2023 00:00 UTC.\nTop 100 bids within the 10 minute timeframe will accumulate points based on their placement on the leaderboard.\nEarned points convert to claimable $RARI at 00:00 UTC every 24 hours.\nWhen you claim your $RARI rewards, they get automatically locked as veRARI for 9 months.\nParticipants will be able to see their rewards here once the program is live.\nThat\u2019s basically it! Oh, we almost forgot to mention that when you lock 100 or more $RARI as veRARI (so you just have to get enough points and the rest is done automatically), you start paying no marketplace fees on Rarible.com and on thousands of Rarible Protocol-powered NFT marketplaces.  \nIf you want to learn more about Mocaverse, visit our blog post. Notably, Animoca Brands just raised $20 million to develop the project, so there is much more to come!\nAs for now, get ready to make bids on those cute Mocas and check out the MocaMart.",

        "post_description": "\ud83d\ude85\nTL;DR:\n\n\u2022 Mattel's Hot Wheels NFT Garage is a great example of how one of the most recognizable IPs in the toys industry is utilizing NFTs to reengage existing audience and attract new collectors.\n\n\u2022 Hot Wheels NFT Garage: Series 6 is launching on August 31, 9:00 AM PT time.\n\n\u2022 Once the drop is live, you'll be able to shop it on the Rarible-powered Mattel Creations Virtual Marketplace.\n\n\u2022 Series 6 will feature a new premium pack that guarantees you a die-cast car, as well as some rarities like 1988 Jeep Wagoneer and Aston Martin V12 Speedster.\nDigital collectibles is one of the things in NFTs that have been steadily growing in 2023 despite the bear market.\nAs the name implies, these NFTs are intended for collectors: People who love a brand or IP and want to interact with it on a deeper level.\nMattel's Hot Wheels NFT Garage is a great example of such project: Iconic die-cast cars a lot of us played with as kids are now put onchain, which makes owning, collecting and trading much easier. Besides, these NFTs enable you to get rare IRL models too\u2014a dream for any collector.\nAs the sixth season of Hot Wheels NFTs approaches its launch date on August 31, 9:00 AM PT, here\u2019s everything you need to know about this project.\nHow Hot Wheels NFT Garage Works\nHot Wheels NFT Garage is a \u2018phygital\u2019 project that was first announced in 2021 on the Wax blockchain. It has since bridged to Flow\u2014the blockchain famous for hosting NBA TopShot, among other mainstream-focused projects\u2014to make collecting as easy and smooth as possible.\nThe idea is simple: you buy a pack of unrevealed NFTs. When you unpack it, you get a set of 4 to 10 random cars of different rarities, depending on the type of pack you got. While they\u2019re primarily virtual collectibles, cars of the \u2018premium\u2019 and \u2018NFTH\u2019 rarities could be redeemed for physical versions.\nNeedless to say, these physical models have also become valuable off-chain collectibles. With only 3000 made of the premium cars and 1500 of the NFTH cars, the redeemed cars can sell for a premium. For instance, scoring a Series 4 \u201869 Copo Corvette costs you over $200 on eBay!\nMattel Creations Virtual Marketplace\nYou can also expand your collection by trading the collectibles on Rarible-powered secondary market. Urgently need a Buick Grand National? Say no more!\nSeries 1-5: Quick summary\nSeries 1 featured 12 classic Hot Wheels cars, including the Deora II, Twin Mill, and Bone Shaker.\nSeries 2 focused on Hot Wheels cars inspired by real-world vehicles, such as the Bugatti Chiron and the Lamborghini Si\u00e1n FKP 37.\nSeries 3 celebrated the 50th anniversary of Hot Wheels with a variety of retro-inspired cars.\nSeries 4 was the first to be hosted on the Flow blockchain, featuring real-life cars including the McLaren P1.\nSeries 5 features future-facing cars like the Aston Martin Vulcan.\nIn addition to the regular seasons, Hot Wheels has also released special feature drops, such as the NFT Garage and the Fast & Furious collaborative collection featuring Dominic Toretto\u2019s legendary 1970 Dodge Charger and other iconic cars from the movie franchise, all of which sold out in under 5 minutes.\nWhat will Series 6 bring?\nMattel recently announced Hot Wheels NFT Garage Series 6. The series is confirmed to feature a new type pack ($80) which guarantees you an extraordinary die-cast car along the standard one ($25), and include rarities like a 1988 Jeep Wagoneer and an Aston Martin V12 Speedster.\nThe countdown to Series 6 launch is live on the Mattel website, and, looking at recent Hot Wheels drops, it is likely to sell out quick. Don't worry about missing it, though\u2014once Series 6 is live, you'll be able to find NFTs from it on the secondary marketplace (just click on the dropdown menu and select the Series you need).\nAs for now, strap in and get ready!",

Part of traders started to view royalties as just another fee they can minimize or bypass altogether to increased their profit margins.\nThis harms the entire NFT space: It frustrates existing creators (who form the backbone of the NFT space), keeps new creators from entering, and even makes the market more speculative by facilitating quick flipping.\nAt Rarible, we have always believed in royalties. That\u2019s why by September 30, 2023 we will stop aggregating orders from OpenSea, LooksRare and x2y2. Royalties on all native listings on Rarible.com, or one of thousands of community marketplaces powered by Rarible, will continue to be fully respected.\nAs a creator, you'll need to encourage people to list and trade on Rarible.com or your Rarible-powered community marketplace to get your well deserved royalties.\nYou also need to double check and make sure that you have set up royalties on Rarible.com so they can be enforced.\nHow to make sure your royalties are enforced on Rarible\nAs a collection owner, you need to set royalties for your project on Rarible to make sure we know where to automatically send them. Here\u2019s how to do that:\nHead to Rarible and connect the wallet that owns the collection you want to earn royalties on.\n2. Use Rarible\u2019s search to find your collection.\n3. On the collection page, claim your collection. This lets you edit the collection page and set royalties (any number up to 50%, decimals supported).\n4. Once you\u2019ve verified your ownership of the collection, click the three dots, click \u201cupdate royalties\u201d and set your royalties to your desired percentage, as well as one or more wallets where they will be sent (keep in mind that adding a lot of wallets might increase the gas fee for buyers).\nAfter doing that, you\u2019ll receive royalties on every single sale that happens on a native listing.\nLet\u2019s #StandForRoyalties together.",

Would BAYC have become a pop cultural phenomenon? Would Nouns have shown the possibilities of DAOs?\nTo amplify this message, we\u2019re launching a completely free Open Edition mint on Polygon, available via the Rarible homepage through the end of next week.\nMint now for free\nThis OE highlights Rarible\u2019s efforts in staying pro-royalties:\nAny creator can launch their own community marketplace on Ethereum or Polygon for free in just a few clicks via the builder.\nNative listings on Rarible.com and all Rarible-powered marketplaces always respect the royalties in full, as envisioned by the creator.\nWe\u2019re providing the tools to make royalties a norm. The more people create their own marketplaces and list NFTs directly there, the more empowered creators become. Empowered creators have more possibilities to push the space forward, which is great for everyone involved.\nThis free mint comes with no utility\u2014think of it as Proof of Support.

        "post_description": "\ud83d\ude85\nTL;DR:\n\n\u2022 McFarlane\u2019s Batman: Year 2 drop is now live on Polygon.\n\n\u2022 Public mint starts at 10:00 AM PT time, July 27 (today).\n\n\u2022 Rarible is hosting both primary (mint) and secondary sales via McFarlane\u2019s custom marketplace.\n\n\u2022 Priced at 70 MATIC, there are 1987 NFTs to be minted\u2014some digitally signed by Todd McFarlane, who also designed the collectibles.\n\n\u2022 The drop follows McFarlane's recent deal with Warner Bros., meaning we're likely to see more DC-licensed NFTs.\nOne of the most exciting developments in Web3 is that more and more IP holders are extending their franchises to digital collectibles.\nIt makes sense: In the digital realm, designers have a more open space for their creative work, while collectors get to enjoy the benefits of true ownership.\nOne brand on the forefront of that is McFarlane Toys. After creating some of the most sought-after physical collectibles IRL, McFarlane entered the realm of web3 with a custom marketplace and minting experience on Polygon powered by Rarible in December last year.\nBut that\u2019s not every area McFarlane is innovating in: Their holder XP system aims to reward the most loyal holders. One example of that: Officially licensed Superman collectibles which were exclusively available for XP holders.\nToday, we\u2019re super excited to share the details of McFarlane's first big DC drop since their massive partnership with Warner Bros was announced: Batman: Year Two!\nThese collectibles are unique for a few reasons:\nThey\u2019re the first-ever DC-licensed NFTs designed by the original comic artist (Todd McFarlane himself).\n200 NFTs in the collection are digitally signed by Todd McFarlane.\nPriced at 70 MATIC (~$50) on Polygon (meaning minimal gas fees) and supported with a credit check out feature during public mint, these NFTs are accessible for a bigger audience.\n\ud83d\udce2\nThe Batman: Year Two mint will have 3 phases:\n\n\u2022 Allowlist 1 (reserved for holders with over 5,000 XP): July 27, 9:00am PT - 55 MATIC\n\n\u2022 Allowlist 2 (reserved for Bat Cowl holders): July 27, 9:45am PT - 62.5 MATIC\n\n\u2022 Public: July 27, 10am PT - 70 MATIC\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t qualified for Allowlist, check in at 10AM:00 PT to mint NFTs from the remaining supply. If you miss the mint, you can always pick your NFT on the secondary marketplace.\n\nAs mentioned above, credit card checkout will be supported during the public mint stage to ensure better accessibility for collectors with little or no Web3 experience.\nNow we won\u2019t spill any alpha yet, but make sure to stay tuned for more DC drops from McFarlane...",

        "post_description": "\ud83d\ude85\nTL;DR:\n\n\u2022 This article explores strategies that 6 different IPs implemented to launch their brands in Web3.\n\n\u2022 NFT market is transforming towards more accessible collections that leverage communities outside of Web3. That's why their efforts don't rely on metas/trends/floor prices as much.\n\n\u2022 We see more popular brands and IPs enter Web3 almost every week: Entertainment franchises, sports organizations, car brands, fashion giants.\n\n\u2022 The blockchain tech helps those brands engage their communities in new, previously impossible ways.\nNFTs are transforming. In 2021, profile pictures (PFPs) dominated: Everyone had a pixel art profile picture or an animal avatar\u2014and those were flying off the virtual shelves. Floor prices skyrocketed, projects got minted out in seconds.\nIn 2023, deep into the bear market, PFPs are no longer as prevalent. Floor prices are going down even across the projects once seen as \u201cblue chips\u201d, and many VCs who rocked CryptoPunk PFPs during the bull have now rebranded to AI experts.\nTruth is, NFTs are very far from dead. They're transforming, which is a healthy process for a technology that has forever revolutionized digital ownership.\nRight now, the market is changing towards art collection and more accessible NFTs that target a bigger audience. In this article, we'll focus on the latter. Those new wave collections are often launched by major brands which aim to bring their existing community to web3 and engage it through unique onchain experiences they couldn't deliver before.\nLaunching in a bear market and not at the hype peak, those projects don\u2019t rely solely on floor prices or whatever is hot on NFT Twitter this week. Instead, they aim to carve their own path in this evolving landscape and are planning longterm.\nLet's delve into six such brands and how Rarible has helped them make the transition.\nFOX\u2019s Krapopolis: Dan Harmon\u2019s NFT-Powered Cartoon\nKrapopolis is a new cartoon by Dan Harmon (co-creator of Rick & Morty) launching in September 2023. Set in Ancient Greece, the show is \"centered on a flawed family of humans, gods and monsters that tries to run one of the world\u2019s first cities without killing each other\".\nThe even more special thing about it?\nKrapopolis is powered by a community of NFT holders. Instead of dictating the story lines and details from the top down, the community gets to vote on what happens in the show and access exclusive experiences. That embodies exactly what Web3 stands for: decentralization and true ownership.\nRarible supported FOX's Web3 arm company (with FOX being the studio behind Krapopolis) with the launch of the Krap Chicken marketplace, where users can get prepared for the upcoming show by trading Krap Chickens\u2014their \"fan passes to enter the gates of Krapopolis\"\u2014and learning about the NFT's utility.\nNotably, even though the first season of Krapopolis is yet to launch, the show has already been renewed for a second and third season\u2014which is rare in the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to brand new IPs.\nMaybe it\u2019s some of that Web3 magic?\nSmurfs: Innovative Bucket Auction to Kickstart Web3 Journey\nEveryone knows these blue characters\u2014whether it\u2019s from figurines, cartoons or video games: The Smurfs persist through the generations.\nLooking to expand to new channels and ways of building community around their IP, Smurfs saw the potential of blockchain technology and decided to enter web3.\nThey auctioned off 3,000 NFTs of their iconic characters with an innovative bucket auction powered by Rarible. Here\u2019s how it worked: There was a (publicly visible) clearing price based on all bids in the auction, which ultimately determined the mint price for a single NFT within the collection. Bids at or above that price were considered \u201cwinning\u201d and received NFT(s) at the end, depending on their bid. Those who bid below the clearing price had their funds fully reimbursed shortly after the auction ended.\nThe event was a massive success for the Smurfs community, raising $1m+ and receiving a bold 250 ETH bid from one of the participants! Both the auction and the secondary marketplace where users could list their Smurfs were powered by Rarible.\nThis unique mechanic showed the Smurfs team's understanding of web3: In the true spirit of decentralization, they let the community decide the mint price.\nBarbie: Ahead of the Curve with Web3 Collaboration\nRepresentation matters. In web3 and elsewhere.\nAs part of its superb marketing strategy for the Barbie movie, Mattel also tapped into digital collectibles. Notably, the company took a collaborative approach to Web3 integration by releasing a PFP collection in partnership with Web3-native brand Boss Beauties to target multiple audiences.\nA core characteristic of this partnership was a focus on accessibility. By minting on the low-gas blockchain Flow at a low price of $25 for a pack of four, these collectibles became accessible to Barbie fans worldwide.\nTo help people collect the Boss Beauties-inspired Barbies they love the most (and even find their dream job), Mattel built the secondary marketplace with Rarible.\nThis shows a transition in the market: Away from oversubscribed premium mints, towards more accessible collectibles in reach of the new audiences.\nMcFarlane Toys: Bringing the DC Universe to Polygon\n\nMcFarlane Toys, renowned for their detailed collectible figures of major media franchises, saw an opportunity to reach a broader audience in the Web3 space.\nBy dropping digital toy collections on Polygon, they provide an accessible entry point for collectors who want to expand their collection to the digital realm.\nMinting on Polygon ensures low gas fees, while a credit card checkout makes it easy for web3 newbies to skip the often complicated onboarding. McFarlane Toys now seems to be doubling down on this approach, as they have recently secured a massive partnership deal with Warner Brothers that will involve multiple exclusive DC drops.\nThe secondary marketplace powered by Rarible makes it easy to get into the new digital ecosystem of McFarlane toys by trading collectibles with other enthusiasts and navigating new drops.\nHot Wheels: Fast cars, Faster Blockchain\nHot Wheels is another iconic Mattel brand selected to get a digital collectible series on Flow, a blockhain that markets itself as the most mainstream ready one due to its speed and minimal gas fees.\nDubbed Hot Wheels NFT Garage, the initial drop was so successful that Mattel followed up with additional collections, with the latest one selling out in 5 minutes. By now, the Hot Wheels NFT Garage has seen 5 series, including a special drop co-branded with the famous Fast & Furious movie franchise that released shortly before the latest film.\nJust like the Boss Beauties x Barbie collection, Hot Wheels NFTs are available on the Rarible-powered secondary marketplace, where collectors are completing their sets to be eligible for extra perks\u2014and we're seeing a lot of Web3 newbies among active traders there. That's what onboarding looks like!\nUSGA: Dynamic NFTs for Golf Fans\nEarlier this month, the United States Golf Association (USGA) released dynamic digital collectibles for golf fans in collaboration with ArtBall and Rarible for the U.S. Women\u2019s Open tournament.\nUtilizing opportunities presented by the NFT tech, each virtual golf ball was tied to a plot on the historic Pebble Beach Golf Club, with the generative artwork updating live following in-tournament happenings on that plot of land.\nAs a result, holders had an extra reason to watch the tournament live and see how their NFTs' metadata updates, and got a unique virtual souvenir in the process. The tournament is now over, but the Rarible-powered marketplace (which also supported the mint) is available for anyone who wants to scoop a fully updated golf ball they like the best.\nWhat's next? Many more brands to enter Web3.\nAs the Web3 landscape evolves, major brands like Smurfs, Barbie, McFarlane Toys, Hot Wheels and USGA are leveraging it to innovate and strengthen community engagement. With mints, marketplaces and other Web3 experiences powered by Rarible, they're introducing more accessible digital collectibles and onboarding their community to web3.\nNFTs is a market that\u2019s always evolving and right now, we\u2019re witnessing the next stage of evolution. And Rarible is here to help power that future.",

The public mint will open in 24 hours. The NFT itself is free with a 2$ mint fee and gas fees.\n\n\u2022 Go to the secondary marketplace to pick the ArtBalls you like.\nAs we keep saying, more and more companies, brands and institutions are starting to adopt digital collectibles, expanding into Web3. Whether it\u2019s The Smurfs, Mattel, McFarlane Toys or so many others\u2014collecting is going online. We\u2019re super excited to see this shift on the market.\nToday, we\u2019re glad to announce our first ever collaboration with a major sporting event: We\u2019ll be supporting both the mint and secondary trading for the 2023 U.S. Women's Open ArtBall project on Ethereum.\nAt the core of the project is amplifying the accomplishments of the incredible athletes and engaging golf fans via a unique, Web3-enabled collection. Here\u2019s how it\u2019ll work:\nArtBall: dynamic digital collectibles\nArtBall is a unique NFT concept that launched with the Australian Open last year. It leverages gamified elements, offering holders dynamic, shot-by-shot generated art that depends on the flow of the championship.\nAs part of the 2023 U.S. Women's Open ArtBall project, fans will have the opportunity to claim an ArtBall uniquely linked to a designated area on and around the iconic 17th hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nEvery holder starts off with the same base ArtBall, and there are 3010 ArtBalls in total. Each shot, pending their position on Hole 17, will cause each ArtBall to uniquely evolve throughout the championship. More specifically, all ArtBalls will be updated with the appropriate scorecard sticker and metadata trait depending if it\u2019s a \u2018Landing Point\u2019, \u2018Closest to the Hole\u2019 and/or \u2018Longest Hole Out\u2019, along with other updated traits and metadata\u2014check this thread for more details and overview of each generative pattern.\nAs the tournament concludes, each ArtBall will have a unique design\u2014watch the secondary marketplace to expand your collection!\nSimple for golf enthusiasts\nThe launch of these digital collectibles will happen in two phases:\nWhite list + secondary sales launch\nPublic launch\nAfter the whitelist period expires at 10:00 AM EST July 6, claiming an ArtBall is open to anyone with an Ethereum wallet.\nDuring the public mint stage, the collectible itself will cost you nothing, but you'll have to pay a small minting fee of $2 (0.00039 ETH) and gas fees.\n\nAlso, to make it accessible for everyone, 2023 U.S. Women\u2019s Open ArtBalls can be purchased with a credit card during the public mint stage.\nIf you want to claim your own ArtBall, head over to the mint site\u2014or, if you miss the mint or want to expand your collection, pick up an ArtBall via secondary!",

        "post_description": "The bear market is deepening, floor prices are falling, and the number of trading wallets is lingering at an all time low.\nMany have left the space, abandoned their project or jumped on the next hype. But here at Rarible, we are more excited than ever about the future.\nWe believe that over the next five years, the ownership and exchange of NFTs will be as commonplace as sending an email. The majority of internet users will mint NFTs and engage with their digital wallets daily. NFTs will become the preferred method for distributing digital goods and services. Making that a reality will require mass adoption of blockchains and NFTs\u2014millions of new users.\nWho will lead the way and usher the next million people into web3? Major brands and innovative companies that create next-level online engagement for their communities.\nAt Rarible, we are building to bring this vision to life.\nBringing the next million people in to web3\nSo far, the NFT space has been limited to several hundred thousands of active users. Why? The entrance barrier has remained high due to UX, transaction prices, and gated access to many opportunities. Since the launch of CryptoPunks in 2017, growth has been incredible, but it has not yet created a sustainable, accessible and safe environment for everyone.\n\nThe only way we can level up web3 adoption is by making it easy and safe for more people to buy and trade NFTs. As the success of NBA Top Shot, Smurfs Society, Hot Wheels and many other NFTs has shown, joining a trustedbrand on this ride has already proven to be the perfect incentive for new users to embrace digital ownership.\nThe great news is: brands get it. Big companies are recognizing the immense potential of NFTs as community-building tools in the next-gen internet to increase loyalty, get closer to their customers, create value and new realms of engagement.\nEven amidst the bear market in 2023, more brands are launching NFTs than ever before. Nike, Reddit, Amazon, Mattel, Starbucks, and Ticketmaster are just a few among the companies aiming to sell millions of NFTs to their fans and collectors.\nThe next stage of NFTs will be retail-focused, driven by brands bringing their communities into the fold.\nHere\u2019s how Rarible is making it happen\nBrands are looking for a resilient, custom solution and a trusted partner for their web3 journey.\nOur decentralized, community-governed infrastructure, over 1 million loyal community members across channels, and years of partnerships with top brands makes Rarible the go-to partner for brands to thrive in the NFT space.\nIn the past 6 months only, Rarible partnered with top brands like Mattel (Hot Wheels, Barbie), Fox, McFarlane, Smurfs and others to create custom minting and secondary trading experiences for their communities. We helped them to generate millions of dollars in revenue and find new ways to connect with their audience, onboarding it to the borderless world of web3 in the process.\nOur vision is to create a dynamic platform that empowers both established and emerging brands and creators to launch their digital products and to cultivate vibrant and sustainable communities in a fun, safe, and easy way.\nLet\u2019s build! The next bull will be fun.\nTo be one of the projects pioneering web3 for their communities, get in touch with us here.",

        "post_description": "\ud83d\ude85\nTL;DR:\n\n\u2022 Animoca Brands' NFT marketplace for their Mocaverse project is live, powered by Rarible\n\n\u2022 The marketplace has two collections: The Mocas (Ethereum) and Realm Tickets (Polygon)\n\n\u2022 The marketplace allows you to easily transfer your Mocas, see XP for each one and easily navigate the collection\nFor web3 to get mainstream adoption, it needs to have real use cases and exciting brands. That\u2019s why we love to partner with brands like Mattel and Smurfs. And while those digital collectibles bring their audiences to web3, crypto-native companies take the opposite route and infuse web3-native culture into awesome experiences.\nAnimoca Brands is instrumental in that. They\u2019re involved with many ambitious web3 gaming projects, having launched The Sandbox metaverse and partnering with Yuga Labs on their upcoming Legends of Mara game, among many others.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve partnered with blockchain gaming pioneer Animoca Brands to build a community marketplace for the Mocaverse.\nBut first, what is Mocaverse?\nIntroducing the Mocaverse\nAnimoca launched Mocaverse to (in their words) \u201cunite the Web3 community to exchange ideas, learn, connect, play games, cultivate a resilient Web3 culture, and build a better future for Web3.\u201c\nTheir 8888 PFP collection encapsulates this vision. In the Mocaverse, 5 Moca tribes co-exist peacefully:\nAngels\nBuilders\nDreamers\nConnectors\nNeo-Capitalists\nEach tribe is a perspective on web3\u2014from the sober economic theorists to the dreamy idealists\u2014and illustrates the diversity that characterizes the web3 community.\nEach Moca grants access to the exclusive community and can participate in a realm to play (get game passes, airdrops and in-game items), do good (contribute to social causes), build (access resources for builders) or learn (in AMAs and masterclasses).\nAll of these are co-created by the community\u2014so you can contribute and join either one to help shape the Mocaverse community.\nBut the Mocaverse hosts not just the Mocas, but a total of two exclusive NFT collections: The Mocas on Ethereum and Realm Tickets on Polygon.\nThe Polygon-based Realm Tickets, on the other hand, were originally key to the \u201cMocalist\u201d, which meant eligibility to mint a Moca. While the Moca mint is over, the Realm Tickets still give occasional access to selected experiences and present a lower-priced entry point into the Mocaverse.\nSurfing the Mocaverse\nWe believe that the future of web3 is defined by innovative brands that create unparalleled community engagement. The Mocaverse has a unique way of engaging holders, which makes us especially proud of partnering with them.\nTo help Moca owners get the most out of the marketplace, it supports:\nMoca XP points, which each Moca accrues through staking, DAO contributions or community activity. You can see XP points for each listed Moca.\nBesides ETH, you can trade in $APE, $SAND, $PROS, $REVV, $GMEE and $EDU. Please keep in mind that the current version of the marketplace only allows you to buy NFTs using the same currency as they\u2019re listed in.\nA transfer feature to make moving your Mocas around much easier (soon to be added to all Rarible-powered marketplaces).\nAdvanced search to enable you to find a favorite Moca you love faster! Want to get a Moca holding DYOR sign? Just type in \u201cDYOR\u201d into the search bar. Want to see all Mocas with the tie-dye background? You know what to do.\nAnd because we want to lower the barrier to entry for web3, the marketplace has no fees of its own.\nUltimately, we hope this marketplace helps foster a unified community. The Mocaverse celebrates unity as the foundation of a thriving ecosystem, a philosophy we support and are happy to partner with!\nIf you want to pick up your first Moca or grow your collection, head over to the marketplace now!",

        "post_description": "\ud83d\udca1\nNFT Cheats by Rarible is a newsletter and blog series that explores the very pillars the NFT space stands on. Think of those as the NFT World-bearing turtles (or Apes).\n\nIt\u2019s called NFT Cheats because each newsletter is designed as a cheat sheet that will bring you up to speed on a given niche within the NFT space.\nNFT bear market is the third subject in the series. The previous issues covered Historical NFTs and NFT Security.\nTo put together a cheat sheet on today\u2019s topic, we talked to wale.swoosh, researcher-in-residence at Azuki and a self-described \u2018Director of Threads\u2019 on NFT Twitter.\nWale got into NFTs in early 2021 after hearing about them on Gary Vee\u2019s Instagram. He joined Twitter a few months after that to become a better trader as he realized that NFT Twitter plays a big role in that. Wale quickly fell in love with the community, and started sharing his own thoughts on the timeline, quickly becoming one of the most popular NFT content writers known for his in-depth threads.\nDO NOT treat any of the information below as financial advice, and do your own research (DYOR) before buying into any asset.\nThe interview has been edited and condensed, meaning the content below is attributed to the guest expert, but shouldn\u2019t be treated as a direct quote.\nWhat does a bear market mean for NFTs?\nA bear market in Web3 is usually marked by a general flattening of interest in the space. Fewer new people join, and some people who were in Web3 leave.\nThat leads to a crash in prices, teams stop developing, and the sentiment in the space is generally bad because everyone is fighting for the crumbs of a shrinking pie.\nIf you look at it historically, bear markets are always caused by an external macro influence. We\u2019ve had several bear markets in crypto since the industry emerged, and this seems to be the first major bear market for NFTs specifically since they hit the mainstream in 2021.\nThe current bear market started around Q2 2022, and of course we just can\u2019t know when it will end exactly. But I'm positive that it will be followed by a bull cycle.\nWhy NFTs are down bad\nWe\u2019ve seen projects shed around 70-90% of their floor prices during this bear market. At this point, it might be hard to believe that certain NFTs were trading at 3-10x their current floor price.\nMoonbirds' historical floor price, as shown by NFTpricefloor.com\nThere are several reasons behind that grand fall. First, a lot of people have simply left the space, and the number of traders is getting lower everyday. According to recent numbers, there are around 7,000 active traders left. When you have a few thousand people creating and trading maybe millions of NFTs\u2026 the supply/demand ratio gets crazy. When the demand is low, the floor price will follow.\nProjects themselves also play a role in this. Without naming any specific ones, we have many teams that have made major strategic mistakes in recent months. In fact, I don't think there are blue chips anymore in the space, outside of the top 3-4 most successful collections.\nThen we had ETH volatility, the memecoin season, Blur experimenting with some trading mechanics \u2014 all of that have also not been good for the floor prices across the board.\nThe most important thing for the NFT space at the moment is to get more people in, because when you have 7k traders, it's really hard to run a successful project. Right now, holders are basically playing hot potato with each other. As to how we might onboard more people \u2014 that's a whole other topic.\nNFTs are dead... Long live NFTs!\nPeople who say NFTs are dead are partly right.\nMost projects are indeed dead or are in the process of dying. 99% of them won't come out of this bear market because they just don't have what it takes. Those who will come out, however, will come out stronger.\nHaving said that, NFTs as a technology will never ever die because it brings so much innovation to areas like gaming and digital ownership, for example.\nMetas, or why there's always a \"shiny thing\" in NFTs\nTo better understand the nature of the NFT market, it's useful to understand the role metas play in it.\nMeta is a certain pattern that we see emerge (most of the time suddenly) and disappear (that also tends to happen quite quickly) in the NFT space.\nA meta can last anywhere from a few days to months. A good example would be the open edition meta we saw a few months ago started by Jack Butcher\u2019s Checks. Once it became clear that Checks are doing good, we saw all those other projects doing open editions, mostly following the same pattern/concept\u2026\nAt the time, the majority of the content on the NFT Twitter timeline was about open editions. That happened because hype plays a core role in metas. Initially, when a new meta emerges, it starts to generate/feed off hype\u2014 everyone wants to be a part of this new exciting thing, and ultimately make some money from it (be it trading, engagement farming, or both).\nIt\u2019s hard to put a finger on what exactly makes a meta pop off, but once it gets going, it spreads fast.\nWale's thread on metas (click to read)\nYou have to realize that sooner or later, every meta always disappears. The people who are invested in it often think (or want you to think) that it\u2019s here forever, but in reality there's always the next shiny thing a few weeks later that people will go chasing after, forgetting about the one that preceded it.\nThat being said, the OG projects that start metas\u2014like Checks, for example\u2014often keep at least some of their relevance, while most other unoriginal projects who were just trying to copy them vanish.\nBesides metas, there\u2019s also culture. Culture is a more fundamental kind of thing. Sometimes it's hard to differentiate: is this new thing more transitory and based on short-term attention, or is it here to actually stay, setting a new standard for the space for years to come?\nThere weren\u2019t many events that actually revolutionized the industry, like what Yuga Labs did when they airdropped the serums for the MAYC collection, the distribution trick many projects adapted later on. But those usually come around in a more subtle manner.\nSo normally when every week you have people saying \u201coh, that's the new thing, it will change the space forever for years to come\u201d and are super vocal about it, it\u2019s almost never the case.\nThe attention span in this space is incredibly short, and people tend to put most of their attention into things that are \u2018meta\u2019 at the moment.\nWill traditional brands kick off the next bull?\nThere are a few examples of traditional brands doing a good job with their web3 initiatives, Gucci and Adidas specifically come to mind. But you and I would probably have a hard time naming 10 successful web2 companies who came into the web3 space, so we haven't seen that unfold just yet.\nWhen it comes to getting new people into NFTs, major brands could be one way to do it \u2014 when people see a trusted brand, they might want to get involved, as they\u2019re more likely to trust a brand they already know.\nIt\u2019s a two-way street: when more people in general will get interested in NFTs, web2 brands will likely have an easier time onboarding people as well.\nIt also depends on which audience the specific brand wants to address. When you want to get into the hardcore NFT community, you better understand web3 culture and be part of it so your activation doesn't feel forced\u2014the infamous Pepsi and Budweiser exchange on Twitter became a meme for a reason. But at the same time, as more legacy brands will come in, the focus might shift away from the core NFT community to retail users.\nAnd when more retail comes in and NFT becomes more adopted as a technology, it is likely that the end user won\u2019t realize that they are interacting with the blockchain or even that they\u2019re buying an NFT. It will be more subtle, and the majority of retail users probably won't be creating wallets and trading NFTs on OpenSea/Blur/Rarible per se.\nNike\u2019s .swoosh is another good example of a web2 x web3 crossover\u2014when you sign up there, you don't even know that you are minting an NFT. I think that's a good approach to bringing more people in, because right now the blockchain infrastructure is still very complicated for new people.\nAt the moment, if you know nothing about web3, blockchain or crypto in general, the learning curve is just too steep: you have to go through the process of creating your own wallet and writing down a 24-word seed phrase, buying and swapping tokens, sometimes bridging\u2014all that just to get an NFT you want. So in regards to mainstream adoption, it will be crucial to build platforms, infrastructure and tools that will be intuitive even for people who are not crypto NFT natives.\nIs it a good time to enter the NFT space?\nIt's a good time to take your time.\nLet\u2019s be honest: If you\u2019re coming into the NFT space right now, there's a very high chance that you will immediately leave. The bear market vibes are really difficult to handle for a newcomer.\nWhen you go on NFT Twitter these days, there\u2019s so much toxicity, shilling and hate going on\u2026 It's really terrible. Then you have short term metas where some people make money and tweet about it nonstop while the silent majority loses money. Of course if you're a newcomer and most of your timeline is talking about how this thing is pumping and they\u2019ve already made 100x on it, you\u2019ll want to join in. The meta will then move on, and most likely you\u2019ll lose money. I think that's driving a lot of people away from our space.\nBut a bear market is actually a great opportunity to learn about NFTs. For me, the ideal way to start in the NFT space is to make a Twitter account, and get involved in NFT Twitter by following some trusted people and just spending time reading their takes, maybe participating in some discussion. And then when you feel comfortable about what you know and feel like you can make informed decisions, then maybe start buying your first NFT or minting your first NFTs (always with the money you can afford to lose).\nRarible Bear Pass, the free open edition mint that generated 683.5k copies\nAs for choosing which projects to join, look at the team behind it. That\u2019s what it is all about in Web 3. When you have a team that's emerged into the space and is actually building for the community, that's a massive green flag. When I make long-term investments, that's usually what I look at.\nI think that the team is way more important than the art/roadmap because if you don't have a team that's able to execute, you can have the best roadmap but the project won't be successful. So my advice would be to invest in people you personally believe in. That worked for me in the past, but please remember that in web3 it can all change within weeks or even days. This space is moving extremely fast, and that hasn\u2019t changed even during the bear market.\nAnd if you're already in the NFT space, it\u2019s a good time to build. When you have a project is a good time to build in silence so you are ready for the next bull market.\n5 people to follow to learn more about the NFT market  \ufe0f\nElena (@ElenaaETH)\nAlex is Building (@AlexIsBuilding)\nLegendary (@Legendary_NFT)\nNFTboi (@nftboi_)\nzaimiri (@zamirii)",

Official Barbie NFTs are here, brought to you by our partner Mattel and web3 brand Boss Beauties, launched via the mainstream ready Flow blockchain.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the collection\u2014and how you can get one right now, even if you don\u2019t have a topped up wallet ready.\nChampioning representation, from web2 to web3\nThe Boss Beauties x Barbie collection shows women from all walks of life and careers to highlight that women can be whoever they want. Representation matters in all professions\u2014from engineering to nursing and from web2 to web3. That\u2019s a value both Barbie and Boss Beauties stand for, which is why we\u2019re super excited about this collaboration!\nThe collection\u2019s early access launched on May 10th, and the public sale launched on May 18th on the Mattel Creations website.\nStarting May 21st (that's today!), the collection is now available on secondary via the Rarible-powered Mattel Virtual marketplace.\nIf you bought a Barbie x Boss Beauties NFT pack as part of the primary sales, you would get four NFTs of 6 different rarities, from Common to Exclusive: Scoring an ultra rare NFT gets you a Barbie Career of the Year doll set and an exclusive collectible even gets you a ticket to World of Barbie!\nEach Barbie also has a role: Some of them are beekeepers, others are park rangers. Fighter pilots? You got it! Feeling more like an astronaut today? There\u2019s a Barbie for that\u2014and for so many other inspiring careers.\nWe want to help you get the exact Boss Beauties x Barbie NFT you want and resonate with the most, so whether you\u2019ve got your eyes on a rare one to expand your personal collection or missed the mint, you\u2019ll find them listed there!\nSeamless onboarding: quicker that getting a physical doll\nWhen NFTs first entered the mainstream, much of it was about how expensive they are. Beeple\u2019s $69m sale, Bieber\u2019s $1.3m Ape and so on.\nThat perception made it difficult for newcomers to even think about buying an NFT. Add wallet creation, seed phrase storage, expensive gas fees and so many other things\u2014and web3 suddenly looks super complex.\nBut if we want to onboard millions more people to web3, we need to make NFTs more accessible, easier to use and make everyone feel at home.\nThat\u2019s why getting a Barbie NFT is as easy as it gets. While Web3 can be complicated for newbies, Mattel Virtual marketplace makes it easy:\nAll virtual collectibles are minted on the Flow blockchain, making gas fees a fraction of a penny\nYou can check out with your credit card (no need to figure out how to top up your wallet first)\nThe marketplace makes creating a crypto wallet as easy as any email login\nAll in all, Barbie virtual collectibles are accessible, even if you\u2019re new to web3, just like Mattel\u2019s Hot Wheels NFTs! We at Rarible strongly believe that accessible NFTs based on popular traditional IPs will play a major role in the future.\nWant to pick up your favorite Boss Beauties x Barbie NFT? Head over to the Mattel Virtual marketplace now!",

        "post_description": "\ud83d\ude85\nTL;DR:\n\n\u2022 Rarible is launching an OpenEdition festival featuring 13 consecutive drops\n\n\u2022 It starts on Tuesday, May 2\n\n\u2022 Secure one or more drops to be eligible for a special surprise ;)\nFollowing your favorite NFT artists on Twitter can be bittersweet: You love seeing their artwork and read what they write about it.\nBut when artists get popular, two things happen:\nFewer collectors want to sell\nDemand drives up prices\nThis makes it hard to buy your favorite artist\u2019s work. Whether it\u2019s in auctions or on secondary, the NFTs quickly cost more than you\u2019d like to pay for an art piece.\nBut a recent phenomenon makes high-level artwork from popular artists far more accessible: Open editions!\nWhat are Open Editions?\nOpen editions are basically the opposite of a 1/1 mint. In an open edition, the number of mints is unlimited, but the timeframe is. This means an artist will open the mint for a certain art piece or collection for 24 hours for the same price\u2014typically quite low.\nThe most popular one recently were Jack Butcher\u2019s Checks and Opepen, which both led to tens of thousands of mints. Both mints were super cheap compared to Jack Butcher\u2019s more scarce work\u2014which made his work more accessible for more of his fans.\nThat\u2019s why open editions are a great medium for both established and emerging artists.\nWhen does the festival start?\nIt starts on Tuesday, May 2 and lasts 13 consecutive days. It will feature 13 diverse artists ranging from up-and-coming to the well-known.\nThe concept is super simple: each drop is a 24-hour open edition, and you\u2019ll have the chance to mint amazing artwork at a low price.\nThe first in the lineup is Numan, a UK-based creator who will be dropping a free mint.\nAfter 13 days, a special surprise will be waiting for you if you mint at least one of the previous editions... We can\u2019t say much more yet ;)\nWhere will it be happening?\nRight on the Rarible's homepage, so you won't miss it!\nAlso, make sure to follow us on Twitter to stay up to date and mint the open editions as soon as they launch!",

This auction will determine the collection's mint price, featuring the first 3,000 NFTs.\n\n\u2022 The remaining 9,500 NFTs will be minted later based on the auction's clearing price, and will be available for purchase on the Smurfs' Society community marketplace, built and powered by Rarible.\nWhether it\u2019s Twitter adopting NFT avatars or Paris\u2019 Centre Pompidou displaying CryptoPunks, we love to see Web3 culture seep into the mainstream.\nBut we also love to see the reverse: Trusted Web2 (or pre-web) brands launching their own NFT projects, onboarding new enthusiasts into the wonderful world of Web3 in the process.\nAs the go-to-market Web3 partner for established and emerging brands, we\u2019re proud to partner with one of the most beloved franchises of all time: The Smurfs!\nAs one of the most enduring entertainment brands, the adorable blue figures have inspired kids across generations and attracted collectors of all ages for over 65 years.\nNow, we're helping the Smurfs launch \u2018The Smurfs\u2019 Society Legendary Collection\u2019, an official collection of 12,500 NFTs building on the Smurfs\u2019 universe, via the custom white-glove bucket auction and community marketplace experiences.\nSmurfs + Web3 = \ud83d\udc99\nToday, on April 18th at 5pm CET (11am ET time), Rarible will host a 48-hour bucket auction for 3,000 3D-rendered Smurf PFPs.\nA bucket auction is a type of auction where the community ultimately decides the mint price. We'll get into that below.\nThe total supply of the PFP collection is 12,500. It consists of 250 Smurf characters of 50 types. With over 300 randomized traits like skins, background FX, etc., each NFT is unique.\nFurther, the cute NFTs come with exclusive utilities, benefits and perks attached to individual Smurf characters (like game tickets for Soccer Smurf, wine bottles for Sommelier Smurf, etc.). Utilities include physical prints, raffles to win prizes, and access to partners\u2019 and artists\u2019 services, products, or artwork. All Smurfs\u2019 Society holders will also get access to other projects currently in the works, namely an upcoming NFT game, and a DAO that curates and finances sustainable projects to protect the planet.\nFor anyone who didn\u2019t win in the auction (or just wants even more Smurfs NFTs), we\u2019ve also built a community marketplace where you can buy a Smurfs PFP on the secondary market! The marketplace launches after the auction ends, on April 20th.\nThere will also be a mint for the remaining 9,500 NFTs from the collection, so make sure to follow The Smurfs Society for more details.\nThe Community Sets the Price\nWeb3 is all about community. That\u2019s why there's no preset mint price for this auction. The bidders will ultimately decide how much ETH the Smurfs are worth!\nAs mentioned above, the Smurfs\u2019 Society will launch with a bucket auction: You can bid on the auction for a chance at getting Smurfs NFTs.\nAt core of the bucket auction is \"the clearing price\", which is calculated by determining the highest price at which all NFTs could be sold at the same price without going past the total supply of NFTs.\nIf your bid is at or above the current \u201cclearing price\u201d, you\u2019ll have one of the \u201cwinning bids\u201d, which means you\u2019ll receive NFT(s) when the auction ends. If the clearing price rises, your bid will be losing and you won\u2019t receive NFTs and get all your ETH back (except gas fees). If your bid was higher than the clearing price, you'll only pay the clearing price and will be refunded whatever ETH you bid above.\nSo, for instance, if the clearing price ends up being 0.5 ETH and you've bid 1.1 ETH, you get two NFTs and 0.1 ETH refunded back to you.\nIn other words: The price is only as high as the community is willing to pay! To find out details about the bucket auction, check out the Smurfs\u2019 Society\u2019s own resources.\nAlso, all winning bids will receive a Fusion NFT of different rarity, depending on the amount of your bid. Fusion NFTs will allow you to customize your Smurf Society NFTs, so it's definitely a good reason to participate in the auction!\nAnd if you miss the auction, don\u2019t worry: You can always pick up the Smurf PFPs on their community marketplace once it goes live after the bucket auction.\nStay tuned by following the Smurfs Society on Twitter or check out the official home page!",

        "post_description": "Ever since Yuga Labs offered its holders the Mutant Apes in 2021, airdrops and subsidiary collections have become a popular strategy for NFT projects. Many of the most successful Web3 brands now have multiple collections that let you join their ecosystem.\nBut when you have multiple collections within one project, that might also create multiple problems.\nFirst, it becomes more difficult to grow and market your ecosystem. Secondly, there are more opportunities for copycat collections and bad actors. Finally, for new people wanting to join the community, it can also be hard to even navigate all of these collections and see how they relate to each other.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve just added support for multiple collections to our community marketplaces on both Ethereum and Polygon!\nYou can now add multiple collections to your Ethereum or Polygon-based marketplace build via Rarible and let your community trade all of them in one place.\nThat gives you multiple benefits:\nYour community can easily navigate your project's ecosystem, and be sure it's fully authentic. Besides, diversifying your offerings can help you attract new audiences!\nWhen your community trades on your marketplace, they are respecting creator fees (granted they trade native listings, or orders aggregated from marketplaces whose stance on royalties haven't been volatile). That means you (or your community, depending on how you set up your marketplace) can get a stream of funds for future growth!\nIt just feels smooth.\nHow to set up multiple collection support on your marketplace\nIt's super easy.\nIf you already have a community marketplace, just navigate to the dashboard and add your other collections there, and your marketplace will support them immediately. You can find the full instructions here.\nWant to add a collection you're affiliated with, but you don't technically own its contract? No worries, you can utilize the multiple collaborators feature in the settings using this simple guide. That way, marketplace owners can grant other wallet addresses access to their community marketplace dashboard. From there, the additional wallet address(s) can add their collections to the marketplace.\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a community marketplace yet, you can set it up for free here and add all your collections you\u2019d like to have on the marketplace.\nBuild a home for your community with us today. Free of charge.",

        "post_description": "\ud83d\udca1\nNFT Cheats by Rarible is a newsletter and blog series that explores the very pillars the NFT space stands on. Think of those as the NFT World-bearing turtles (or Apes).\n\nIt\u2019s called NFT Cheats because each newsletter is designed as a cheat sheet that will bring you up to speed on a given niche within the NFT space.\nNFT Security is the second subject in the series (you can see the previous issue on Historical NFTs here).\n\nTo put together a cheat sheet on today\u2019s topic, we talked to Feld from Boring Security, a community-led Web3 security project.\nFeld got into crypto before the big run up in 2013. \u201cThat was a fun time to be in crypto for sure,\" he chuckles. \"All graphic cards were sold out. Signing up for Coinbase was nearly impossible\".\n\nAt the time, Feld was transitioning his career to security, which has been his day job since. Feld is also known as a moderator in the BAYC Discord, where he\u2019s been helping the community with stolen items.He eventually started Boring Security with eight people who wanted to address the security problem in the crypto space without turning it into a business.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems in the space now is when you hear someone say something about security, they either have something to sell you, or they're not saying quite the right things,\u201d Feld explains.\nBefore we jump into it, here\u2019s a boring, yet important disclaimer; DO NOT treat any of the information below as financial advice, and do your own research (DYOR) before buying into any asset.\nThe interview has been edited and condensed, meaning the content below is attributed to the guest expert, but shouldn\u2019t be treated as a direct quote.\n2 security problems you should fix ASAP \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\nThere are two things that can seriously compromise your security right now.\nThe first is not realizing how bad not having a hardware wallet is. Not using one is just plain silly.\nStoring a seed phrase on your local machine would also fall into that category. We're doing all kinds of stuff on our devices, and once someone gets access to it, they get access to your seed phrase, meaning all of your assets can be gone in an instant.\nSecondly, not understanding the relationships between approvals and signatures is also dangerous.\nIt is surprisingly easy to sign away an asset with a simple (gasless) message from a phishing (or compromised) site that uses your perfectly legitimate approval to a marketplace like OpenSea, against you. This is why we emphasize heavily at Boring Security to have different wallet addresses for different activities on the blockchain, so that one mistaken signature doesn\u2019t empty dozens of assets at once!\nUsing different wallets for different occasions (i..e having a mint wallet, a vault wallet etc. \u2014 we\u2019ll get into that later) and understanding of approvals and signatures should provide a solid foundation that will allow you to be better off than 95% of the space.\nBecause at the end of the day, what we're really trying to do at Boring Security is to help people protect themselves from themselves.\nLike eventually I'm gonna wake up at 5:00 am, I'm gonna do a mint\u2026 am I necessarily going to read the smart contract if it's a hype mint and I've got a 10 second window to get my transaction through?\nIf you\u2019re doing this on the same wallet address that contains valuable crypto or NFTs, (eventually) you\u2019re gonna have a bad time.\nBefore you connect your wallet to any website \ud83d\udd0c\nWhen you connect your wallet, what you're really doing is you're giving that Dapp the ability to see what assets and approvals you have on that wallet.\nSo basically, it lets that Dapp see the entire state of your wallet and therefore assess what single signature or transaction they can prompt to you that can take the most amount of that money.\nIt also lets that Dapp send transaction requests at you. So when you connect to Rarible, for example, you go there to sell an NFT. When you hit that sell button, what happens? Your Metamask pops up, meaning a transaction request is sent to you. That is what connecting your wallet allows those Dapps to do.\nThe key thing here is that just by connecting, there is no inherent risk of losing your funds.\nBut there's a tail risk: sometimes malicious sites try to double request, meaning they'll send you two scam transactions with the hope being that you reject one of them, and then later when you go to do a legitimate transaction elsewhere, you approve the other one without thinking because that request was still pending on your Metamask.\nThere are also some vulnerabilities that could happen if you\u2019re not using a hardware wallet: for instance, if there was an active clickjacking vulnerability on Metamask, or if there was a browser vulnerability that allowed some other weird behavior. That is highly unlikely, but still yet another reason that you should be using a hardware wallet when you're going around Web3.\nBefore you sign anything with your wallet \ud83d\udcb3\nOnce you've connected and the Dapp sends you a signature request, there\u2019s a couple of things I tell people to consider.\nFirst, I always say to use bookmarks and bookmarks.\nWhat I mean by that is when you connect your wallet to a Dapp, you should go to that site using a bookmark that you double verified.\nImagine you're gonna go to Rarible. You know it's not rarible.xyz, because on the Rarible official Twitter, it says: \u201crarible.com\u201d. Once you know that, you can go there and bookmark that URL.\nThen you can take an extra step. Whenever you get to interact with the Rarible contract while on the official URL, you bookmark that contract address as well.\nThis is something I don't see a lot of people doing, but the benefits of that are actually huge.\nImage courtesy of Boring Security from their free NFT Security 101 class\nBecause now if you're interacting with that legitimate website, you can tell: \u2018Hey, the contract changed\u2019. Why is that? Maybe the website got hacked. Maybe they did a contract upgrade. Either way, it\u2019s something you should probably look into before doing a transaction there.\nThat is why knowing that you're on the right website and knowing that you're interacting with the right contract is huge.\nAdditionally, knowing what you sign and then understanding the different signature types is all so very helpful. Which is why I\u2019m not a big fan of Dapps that just shoot you a big hex string instead of human readable messages when you\u2019re signing a transaction.\nUtilizing things like Transaction Insights - and other tools that decode your transaction before you sign them - can help a great deal with that.\nSignatures vs confirmations \ud83e\uddf1\nSome people think that transactions are more dangerous than signatures, while I would actually say that the opposite is true.\nImagine you have a wallet that has an approval for OpenSea for every collection that you have in there. All this stuff can instantly be taken with one signature, one gasless message.\nWhereas if you have a really clean vault, there's no way to send all your NFTs from there at once. I can't send you my Bored Ape and my Punk in the same transaction without making a proxy or some other crazy stuff first.\nSo I'm actually more afraid of signatures, as they're generally harder to decode by wallets and they're a little bit more confusing on what exactly they're leveraging.\nAnd that leads me to the next point.\nThe 3 wallet method: Why you should adapt it NOW \ud83e\udea2\nThere is a three-wallet method that I recommend adopting.\nImagine you have a mint wallet, a marketplace wallet and a vault wallet. You could have all three of these addresses on your Ledger, Trezor, etc.\nNeedless to say, you can have as many addresses as you want, but we recommend having at least three\u2014especially if you're living and breathing Web3.\nImage courtesy of Boring Security \nThe mint wallet you use to connect to all kinds of Dapps, you can pretty much do whatever you want with it (as long as you don't download malware and use common sense, of course).\nYou have a small amount of funds in there, just as much as you might need to mint a project here or there. Even if you're a big whale, you should never have more than 2 to 5 ETH in there, and I think most people should have far less than that. Mine, for example, has about 0.4 ETH in there right now.\nThen you have your marketplace wallet. This is the one that you're a little bit more careful with. You should only connect it to established NFT marketplaces like Rarible, Foundation, OpenSea, etc. because this is where you're probably going to have a couple of assets that you may be actively trying to sell (which means they have open approvals on them, and therefore a simple gasless signature that starts with a hex code or something like a SeaPort port listing, can take everything you have approved \u2014 all at once).\nFinally, we have this idea of a vault wallet that you should have no approvals on whatsoever.\nThis wallet should contain all of your highest valuable assets that you are not actively trying to sell. The logic is really simple: if you don't have any approvals on that wallet (to marketplaces, etc.), no message (gasless) signatures can get you.\nThe only thing that could get you is if you're actually making an approval transaction on your vault wallet, which should trigger the mental model you adapt with your vault wallet: \u201cOh my gosh, it's requesting an approval on my vault wallet - nope!\u201d.\nYou should be very careful when you connect your vault wallet to any Dapp. But what I tell people is just don't even put any ETH in your vault wallet. Like, you can connect it to PREMINT or Collab.Land, and even if those services get hacked, there is no signature or approval request that can wreck you because, well, you have no ETH to sign the transaction anyway. And there's no signature in the world that can get you because you don't have any approvals that are open anyway.\nAnd so people think it's weird because I tell them: \u201cgo crazy, go sign whatever you want on your vault wallet - just make sure you keep it a vault.\nEvery once in a while, even if you know you haven\u2019t signed any approvals, check it on Revoke.cash or a similar site just to be safe.\nAssume you're the target \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f \ufe0f\nPeople are not used to being targeted individually: Unless you\u2019re 70 or older, the probability of you being actively targeted by and/or falling for web2 scams is super low. Most of the time those emails about a random $300 bill that you can \u2018refund\u2019 just fall into your spam box, never to be seen or opened.\nBut the game changes when it's a targeted scam, and there is much more of that in the Web3 space.\nImage courtesy of Boring Security\nCrypto is a \u2018dog eat dog\u2019 kind of world, and there will be people who will target you individually, slide into your DMs and act very friendly.\nIf somebody assumes that you might be a little bit or inexperienced and you hold something valuable, you can become the target. They will follow you into every Discord server that you're in, check your tweets. There are discord add-ons where they can see all servers, see what permissions you have on each one.\nScammers never sleep, these guys are crazy. So you should realize three things:\nYou can be a target\nYou're in control of your own destiny\nThere are resources out there to help you\nLevelling your security before you put in a ton of money is always a good idea. Experiment, go have fun, be curious, but then once you start putting in real money, take the time to make sure you're doing things right.\n5 NFT Security people to follow \u270f\ufe0f \ufe0f\nBoring Security (@BoringSecDAO)\n0xQuit (0xQuit)\nWiiMee (@Wii_Mee)\nSimonart online (@SimonartOnline)\nfoobar (@0xfoobar)",
